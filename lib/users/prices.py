"""This module helps going from a revenue cat platform_product_identifier to
a useful price.

Specifically, this module helps with the following flow:

1. Have a user (typically, the logged in user on a client via their id JWT)
   and you want to display what plans they can buy on a particular platform
2. Typically, switch to backend code via an HTTP API call to our servers
3. Verify the user doesn't already have the `pro` entitlement on any of their
   revenue cat identities
4. Get identifies for what Package's RevenueCat wants to display for their latest
   revenue cat id.
   (Package is `identifier: string` plus `platform_product_identifier: string`)
5. **THIS MODULE** Convert from `platform_product_identifier` to a price that
   can actually be displayed. For example, $49.99/year after 3 day free trial,
   then $99.99/year
6. Display the price to the user
7. User purchases the product, for native apps this is done via communication
   with the app store without our involvement. For stripe, we need to build them
   a checkout session to go to.

Note that for client apps, the step this module take needs to occur on the
device rather than on our server, because it needs to communicate with the
corresponding app store and do price localization. That's why RevenueCat 
does not include the price in the API response. For Stripe, however, any
localization needs to be done by us, hence the need for us to act as the
app store for returning prices

This is the platform-agnostic code, i.e., models and glue code. The platform
specific stuff is in e.g. stripe_prices.py

Note that this is meant to just fill in for PurchasesStoreProduct from the
revenue cat sdk where the revenue cat sdk is unavailable (e.g., the web).
The models are purposely made to be as swappable as possible.

RevenueCat has this annoying technique of using an internal libraries types in
their API boundaries

https://revenuecat.github.io/react-native-purchases-docs/7.18.0/classes/default.html#getOfferings

returns Promise<PurchasesOfferings>, but PurchasesOfferings is imported
from '@revenuecat/purchases-typescript-internal', whose index method
https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-hybrid-common/blob/main/typescript/src/index.ts
is just a bunch of `export * from ` statements. If we dig down, however, we can eventually
find the type 
https://github.com/RevenueCat/purchases-hybrid-common/blob/main/typescript/src/offerings.ts#L326


Via `offerings.current.availablePackages[n].product` there is actually useful price
information. Specifically, `priceString` generally relates to the formatted price in
the local curency, and `subscriptionPeriod` is how long the entitlement lasts.

So this clearly contains the right information, but the documentation has a lot to be
desired: is the price an integer? Whats an example of the price string? Why are there
potentially multiple options on Google Play for a single price, when prices are already
restricted to a particular product? How can you tell if they are eligible for an intro
price?

https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started/displaying-products

This clearly shows everything we want; it displays two options,
includes a price comparison (SAVE 38%), includes trial text. We
just need to figure out how to extract that information from the
above object, and then reverse how to construct that object from
that information! But they don't actually explain how to do that :(

They have an example app called MagicWeather, but it renders using their
native UI paywall:

https://github.com/RevenueCat/react-native-purchases/blob/main/examples/MagicWeather/src/screens/PaywallScreen/index.js

They use title, description, and priceString. Clearly this is missing
the discount, trial period, etc...

If we look over their github issues we can find examples of what the
objects used to look like and some useful discussion:

https://github.com/RevenueCat/react-native-purchases/issues/727

Best guess from that:

- Price to show: `priceString`, e.g., $3.49

Determining if its a subscription: `productCategory` == `SUBSCRIPTION`;
otherwise, assume lifetime

If subscription:

- Period to show: `subscriptionPeriod`, e.g., `P1M`, requires parsing ISO 8601
- Trial period: `introPrice.period` @ `introPrice.priceString` for `introPrice.cycles` cycles
  If the intro price is zero, otherwise, ignore it and treat it as a discount below

discounts:
- ios:
  in order, after the trial, before the infinitely recurring price from just `priceString`, show
  - `discounts[n].period` @ `discounts[n].priceString` for `discounts[n].cycles` cycles
- android:
  - `defaultOption.pricingPhases[n].price.formatted` @ `defaultOption.pricingPhases[n].billingPeriod.iso8601` 
     for `defaultOption.pricingPhases[n].billingCycleCount`
    SKIP the first one if it's free, as it is just the trial period

what we do -> adapt stripe to the android model, dropping all fields except those
required for the above. This should allow downcasting in typescript from the RC
model to the model returned here

NOTE:
    Google Play supports prepaid subscriptions via pricing phases `offer_payment_mode`,
    e.g., you can buy 1 year at a set price. We include enough to at least error out on
    the client if that's the type of offer, which is in the pricing phase offer_payment_mode
    and recurrence_mode
