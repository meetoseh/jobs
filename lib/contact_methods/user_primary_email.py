    """Returns the appropriate pypika join clause for joining users
    to user_email_addresses, but only the primary user email address.

    The resulting join will produce 0 or 1 rows and will always contain
    1 row if the user has at least one email address.

    unsuppressed, then preferring verified, then preferring lower ids.
