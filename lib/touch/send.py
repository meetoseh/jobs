    """A method to contact the given user using the touch point
    with the given event slug on the given channel, using the given event
    parameters (which differ based on the touch point used). Typically the
    success/failure callbacks are used for persisting/deleting user touch
    links within the event parameters.

    This only handles pushing the request to the `touch:to_send` queue. It
    checks for backpressure, failing the request with `SendTouchBackpressureError`
    if it's too full.

    Visibility into this system is extensively available; look for entries in
    `user_touch_debug_log`, `user_touches`, and `user_touch_point_states`.
    Furthermore, see the various explanations, values, and charts within the
    admin visibility section (touch, sms, email, push). Database updates will
    be delayed as we target less than 1/10 of a write transaction per touch
    (via batching). Most values in the visibility section will update immediately as
    they are buffered in redis for ~48 hours before being written to the database.

    This function will always send the touch in its own redis transaction,
    so for batching you should use `send_touch_in_pipe` instead. This functions
    implementation can be used as a guide for how to use `send_touch_in_pipe`.

        uid (str, optional): if specified, used for the touch uid. Otherwise,
            a random one is generated.
        success_callback (JobCallback, optional): called as soon as any of the
            destinations selected succeeds.  Not passed any bonus parameters.
        failure_callback (JobCallback, optional): called after the delivery is
