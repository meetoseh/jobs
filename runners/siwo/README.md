# Sign in with Oseh

This contains runners from the Sign in with Oseh identity system. Note that these
are not operating on users on the Oseh platform, so some tools aren't going to be
useful (e.g., the touch system itself works with users on the Oseh platform and
thus can't be used directly, but the email subsystem works on emails and thus can
be used)
